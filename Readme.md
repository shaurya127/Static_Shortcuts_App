## Static Shortcuts App

Welcome to the Static Shortcuts App! This Android application demonstrates the implementation of
fixed (static) shortcuts for various activities within the app. With static shortcuts, users can
quickly access specific features or activities directly from the launcher.

# Overview

An Android application may contain several services or features for the user. Static shortcuts
provide a convenient way for users to jump directly to these features without navigating through the
entire app. This project showcases the creation and implementation of static shortcuts for up to
four different activities within the app.

# Features

- Implementation of static shortcuts for quick access to app activities.
- Up to four fixed shortcuts available directly from the launcher.
- Each shortcut leads to a specific activity within the app.
